# FdF

This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french, hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to program.

Makefile suported the next command: make all, clean, fclean, re.
Directory /maps supported some test maps.

#### Usage:
+ make
+ ./fdf maps/map_name

#### Exemple:
The 42 map in two modes and mountin (t1 - the name of map).
